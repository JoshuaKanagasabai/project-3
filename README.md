Encrypts and decrypts messages using a binary search tree

i x — insert cleartext word x into the codebook.

r x — remove cleartext word x from the codebook.

e 'cleartext message' — encrypt the given cleartext message. Each cleartext message consists of words separated by single spaces, and the entire message is surrounded by single quotes. There are only two single quotes (the first and last).

d 'encrypted message' — decrypt the given encrypted message. Each encrypted message has the same format as a message to encrypt, but the words are encrypted.

p — print the codebook in preorder format, visiting left children before right children.

q — quit the program (stop processing input) — this is always the last command.
